 Python Dictionary Data Type
Python dictionaries are kind of hash table type. A dictionary key can be almost any Python type, but are usually numbers or strings. Values, on the other hand, can be any arbitrary Python object.

Python dictionary is like associative arrays or hashes found in Perl and consist of key:value pairs. The pairs are separated by comma and put inside curly brackets {}. To establish mapping between key and value, the semicolon':' symbol is put between the two.
